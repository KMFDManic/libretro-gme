Update:
-Timers tweaked (particularly the Chocobo
 theme, which was quite off.)
-Tracks re-ordered. The "combined" version
 of Dancing Mad is a nice bonus, but that
 just isn't how it's done in-game.
-Three new ambient tracks.


Original readme.txt:

  Thanks for downloading my FF3E soundtrack. It was created by hacking the
SRM file to change the song. The filenames of the songs are FF3E-Sxx.SPC
where xx is the value of this "Song Byte." There were two occassions where
this produced only silence, and thus those numbers (00 and 81) are excluded.
Everything past 84 yield only the Prelude, so those were excluded as well.
